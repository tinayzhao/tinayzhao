# Hi I'm Tina. ðŸ‘‹

I am a **Software Engineer at Amazon** with strong leadership and communication skills from a demonstrated history of teaching and club leadership positions.

I graduated from UC Berkeley with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science in May 2020. During my time there, I interned at several companies, taught data structures as a TA, and mentored students through various CS clubs. Out of everything so far, I really enjoyed teaching!

In my free time, I work on programming projects with friends.
